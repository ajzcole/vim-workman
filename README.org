#+TITLE: Vim-workman
#+DESCRIPTION: Workman-bindings for vim.

This plugin is much simpler than [[https://github.com/nicwest/vim-workman][nicwest/vim-workman]], which is maps keyboard layouts between qwerty and workman for normal mode, insert mode or both.
The aim of this plugin is to rearrange only the movement keys (h,j,k,l for qwerty) in normal mode.

** Movement
- =y= for left
- =n= for down
- =e= for up
- =o= for right
** Rearranging other keys
- =h= for next end of word (instead of =e=)
- =j= for next search (instead of =n=)
- =k= for copy/yank (instead of =y=)
- =l= for new line (instead of =o=)

* Credits
- Code for the plugin is a huge ripoff of Luke Smith's [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/vimling][vimling]] plugin.
- The workman keyboard layout was originally designed by OJ Bucao (see [[https://workmanlayout.org]])
